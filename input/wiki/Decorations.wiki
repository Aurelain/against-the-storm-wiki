= Decorations =

Decorations are used to advance [[Hearth#Hearth Upgrades | Hearths]]. All Decorations take 10 seconds to be constructed. You can unlock more Decorations via [[Smoldering City#Deeds | Deeds]]. You can also Convert certain [[Glade Events]] into unique Decorations with special effects.

There are three different kinds of Decorations:
* '''Comfort''': Even the most rudimentary encampment needs distractions.
* '''Aesthetics''': The more a settlement grows, the more demand there is for beauty.
* '''Harmony''': Peace of mind can be as important as shelter and food in these harsh lands.
