When exploring [[Glades]], a player may often encounter structures or creatures within the glades, called '''Glade Events'''. These events are recognizable by an overhead exclamation mark, and often take the appearance of a ruined building, a survivor encampment, abandoned caches, etc. Events found in [[Dangerous Glades]] or [[Forbidden Glades]] are paramount to be handled quickly, as they often may pose a threat to your settlement if leaving unattended for too long.

Each kind of Glade Events always offers an option of two choices, which (depending on the event) most of the time could be deconstructing them for [[Resources]], repairing the building or recruiting the survivors to expand your settlement, or to send all results to the Citadel in exchange for [[Amber]], and sometimes [[Reputation]]. Investigating a Glade Event always comes paired with a cost. Either with a payment of certain resources, a temporary effect affecting your settlement, or both. Each are explained in depth on the specific events below.

== Glade Event Types ==
There are five types of Glade Events:
* [[Abandoned Caches]]
* [[Survivor Camps]]
* [[Ruined Buildings]]
* [[Dangerous Events]]
* [[Forbidden Events]]
