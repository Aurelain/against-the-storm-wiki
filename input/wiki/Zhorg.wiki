[[File:Zhorg_Portrait.png|255px|thumb|right|Zhorg's in-game portrait]]Zhorg is a [[Trader]] and Quartermaster of the First Dawn Company.

He is one of two Traders (the other being [[Sahilda]]) available from the start of the game before you unlock any other Traders. Zhorg can come to your settlement at any point of its life cycle, but he is most likely to come before you hit 33 City Score.

Assaulting Zhorg rewards you with up to 50% of his goods and 30% of his [[Blueprints]] and [[Perks]], kills 2-5 of your [[Villagers]], raises [[Queen's Impatience]] by 2, prevents higher level Traders from coming to your settlement and increases the time it takes for Traders to arrive by 50%.
