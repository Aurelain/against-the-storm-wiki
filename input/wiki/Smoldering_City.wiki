= Smoldering City =

The world is plagued by the [[Blightstorm]] - a vile cycle of destruction ravaging everything in its path.  The only safehaven is the '''Smoldering City''', where the mysterious [[Scorched Queen]] reins.  As a [[Viceroy]] of the crown, your goal is to help rebuild the Smoldering City.

== Upgrades ==

The Scorched Queen has decided that the Smoldering City requires 7 new great work projects: the Obsidian Archives, the Monastery of the Vigilant Flame, the Pioneers' Gate, the First Dawn Headquarters, the Dim Square, the Brass Forge, and the Vanguard Spire.

From the Upgrades tab of the Smoldering City, you can spend [[Resources#Citadel Resources | Citadel Resources]] - such as [[File:Icon MetaResource FoodStockpiles.png|16px]] Food Stockpiles, [[File:Icon MetaResource Artifact.png|16px]] Artifacts, and [[File:Icon MetaResource Machinery.png|16px]] Machinery - to construct and upgrade these great works.  Each great work improves your Settlements' chances for survival in a particular way, and certain upgrade levels will unlock new game features.

Each level of these great works grants:
* '''Obsidian Archives''' - Queen's Patience: -2% to the speed at which the Queen's Impatience grows per upgrade level (max. -34%)
* '''Monastery of the Vigilant Flame''' - Everlasting Flames: +2% to burning duration for all fuels burned in the Hearth per upgrade level (max. +18%)
* '''Pioneers' Gate''' - Villager Speed Increase: +2% increase to Villager walking speed per upgrade level (max. +20%)
* '''First Dawn Headquarters''' - Unforeseen Riches: +1% boost to the chance of obtaining bonus production yields per upgrade level (max. +10%)
* '''Dim Square''' - Quicker Trader Arrival: +3% bonus to trader arrival speed per upgrade level (max. +27%)
* '''Brass Forge''' - Production Speed Increase: +2% boost to global production speed per upgrade level (max. +18%)
* '''Vanguard Spire''' - Gathering Technique: +1 available charge to all resource deposits per upgrade level (max. +9)

Other rewards include:
* '''Obsidian Archives''' - increases the Citadel Resource rewards for completing a Settlement, and unlocks many new game features such as Consumption Control, Rainpunk Engines, rival Viceroys, [[Royal Expeditions]], [[Timed Orders]], [[Training Expeditions]]
* '''Monastery of the Vigilant Flame''' - increases your [[Cornerstone]] pool and reroll chances
* '''Pioneers' Gate''' - increases your Embarkation points, and extends the vision of your Settlements and your Embarkation range
* '''First Dawn Headquarters''' - adds new Embarkation choices and increases your Embarkation points
* '''Dim Square''' - allows and increases the number of [[Trade Routes]], and improves the cost and availability of [[Perks]]/Blueprints from [[Traders]]
* '''Brass Forge''' - allows [[Hearth]] upgrades, and increases worker and building capacities
* '''Vanguard Spire''' - adds race-specific [[Housing]] to your [[Essential Buildings]] and improves your Caravan choices and Newcomers
