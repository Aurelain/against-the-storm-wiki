[[File:Wiki Trading.png|thumb|320px|Vliss Greybone Trading screen]][[File:Dim_Square_Level_1_Upgrade.png|320px|thumb|right|Dim Square Level 1 Upgrade]]
Once you build a [[Trading Post]], Traders will visit you periodically. You can barter with them by selecting their goods and offering some of your [[Resources]] in return. The goods Traders can offer are Resources, [[Perks]], [[Blueprints]], [[Reputation]] and [[Mystery boxes]].

After you unlock the [[Dim Square]] Level 1 upgrade in [[Smoldering City]], Trading Posts also allow you to establish [[Trade Routes]] with nearby settlements.

==Traders==

Once a Trader arrives in your settlement, you are going to see a notification pop up and the Trader's circle icon is going to appear where the Trading Post building was placed. You can pull up their Trading Post screen by clicking on their icon or the Trading Post building. RMB click is going to hide their icon, but you can still interact with the Trader by clicking on the Trading Post building until they leave.

When trading Resources on the Trader's Trading Post screen, the bar beneath the selected goods will show you if the Trader is happy with your proposal, and once the bar turns green, you can press the "trade" button to confirm the transaction.

When trading Perks, Blueprints, Reputation, and Mystery boxes on the Trader's Trading Post screen, you need to have enough Amber {{Amber}} in your inventory. It is going to be substracted from your inventory automatically once you click on the icon in the bottom section of the Trader inventory.

When there's no Trader in town, you can select the Trading Post and find out when the next one arrives. Arriving Traders can be called immediately at the cost of 0.5 [[Queen's Impatience]]. The Impatience cost doubles with every subsequent trader call. If the Trader arrives during the Storm season, their arrival is delayed until the following drizzle season. 

With the exception of [[Sir Renwald Redmane]], Traders can be attacked by pressing the sword icon in the Trade Panel. This will take 30-50% of their item stacks and 30% of their Blueprints and Perks, as well as kill 1-6 villagers, raise Queen's Impatience by 2-3, prevent higher level Traders from coming to your settlement, and increase the Trader arrival time by 50%. Additionally, [[Sothur The Ancient]] will punish you with [[Amber Curse]], which causes your Amber {{Amber}} to be worth 90% less to any future traders,  effectively eliminating Trade Routes from viability and removing blueprint and perk purchase for the rest of the run. If your City Score is low enough, assaulting Traders will prevent any Traders from coming to your settlement until you raise your City Score above 0.
==Perks==
