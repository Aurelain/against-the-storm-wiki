The World Map is filled with things waiting to be discovered. Every point of interest on the map is marked with a '?' symbol, and may turn out to be either a [[Modifier]] or a Treasure Chest. Both are very rewarding.

Modifiers are special types of objects that change the rules of the game (for example: by allowing you to move every building in your settlement, or by blocking your ability to trade). To take on a Modifier, simply settle on a map tile adjacent to it. After winning a game near it, the Modifier will disappear, and you will be rewarded with additional [[Resources#Citadel Resources | Citadel Resources]].

Treasure Chests, on the other hand, don't require you to settle near them to claim their contents. Once you discover a chest, simply select it on the World Map to open it. A chest must be within your Embark Range to be collected.

Every 12 years there is a Blightstorm that will reset the world map.

== Biomes ==

Biomes determine what resources will be available for a settlement. In addition each biome has one or more unique effects.  [[The Forest#Trees | Trees]] always provide Wood, and sometimes other bonus resources.
