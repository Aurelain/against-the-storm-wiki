[[File:Human Portrait.png|255px|thumb|right|Sahilda's in-game portrait]]Sahilda is a [[Human]] General [[Trader]].

She is one of two Traders (the other being [[Zhorg]]) available from the start of the game, before you unlock any other Traders. Sahilda can come to your settlement at any point of its life cycle, but she is most likely to come before you hit 33 [[City Score]].

Assaulting Sahilda rewards you with up to 40% of her goods and 30% of her [[Blueprints]] and [[Perks]], kills 1-4 of your [[Villagers]], raises [[Queen's Impatience]] by 2, prevents higher level Traders from coming to your settlement and increases the time it takes for Traders to arrive by 50%.
