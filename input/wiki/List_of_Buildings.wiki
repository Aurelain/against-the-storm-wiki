=== Camps ===

''Main article: [[Camps]]''

[[File:Construct Camps.png|x32px|Camps|link=]]

[[Camps]] are starting points for your settlement to go out into the wild to gather [[Resources]] from the map in a small area around them with an efficiency of one star ({{1Star}}). Selecting a Camp from the construction menu will highlight this collection [[Buildings#Range|range]] and the Resource Deposits or [[Trees]] from which the Camp can gather.  All camps require [[Parts]] and some require [[Wood]] and take 14 or 15 seconds to be constructed. All Camps can be moved for free.

=== Food Production ===

Food production Buildings include [[Farms]] and Buildings whose primary purpose is [[Recipes]] for food. Many of these buildings also produce non-food items from farming or include non-food Recipes. This may give you more options or less in choosing your [[Blueprints]], depending on how strict your needs are. The [[Farm Field]] takes only 3 seconds to construct. The Farms take 30 seconds to build. The other food production Buildings take 30, 40, or 50 seconds to build, roughly corresponding to the Building's size.

=== Housing ===

Housing Buildings must be constructed within range of a [[Hearth]] to work. These Buildings satisfy [[Villagers]]' [[Shelter Need|need for Shelter]], and some also satisfy their [[Housing Need|need for their Species-specific Housing]]. All housing Buildings take 40 seconds to be constructed.

=== City Buildings ===
City Buildings include Buildings that provide [[Services]] and [[Passive Effects]] and the Buildings that everyone starts out being able to access that provide essential settlement functions of [[Hearths]], [[Storage]], and [[Trade]]. Service Buildings can be quite expensive to build, costing upwards of several dozen building materials. The [[Blight Post]] and [[Forsaken Altar]] become available at different [[Difficulty]] levels: Veteran and Prestige 1, respectively.
