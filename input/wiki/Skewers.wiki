<blockquote>A Lizard specialty. Produced by: Cookhouse, Grill, Butcher.</blockquote>

Skewers are [[Resources#Complex_Food|Complex Food]] preferred by [[Lizards]] and [[Harpies]]. Each of your [[Villagers]] that [[Complex Food Need|fulfills their need for Skewers]] receives a bonus to their [[Resolve]].


== Produced in ==

Three-star Buildings
* [[Grill]] ({{3Star}})
Two-star Buildings
* [[Cookhouse]] ({{2Star}}), available at early Levels
* [[Butcher]] ({{2Star}}
One-star Buildings
* ''none''
Zero-star Buildings
* ''none''

== Recipes ==

Before any [[Perks]] are applied, the [[Recipe]] for Skewers in all [[Buildings]] yields 10 Skewers. In the 3-star [[Grill]] ({{3Star}}), the Recipe requires 3 of the protein ingredient (except one fewer if it's [[Jerky]]) and 3 of the secondary ingredients. In the two-star ({{2Star}}) Buildings, the Recipe requires 4 of the protein (except one fewer if it's [[Jerky]]) and 4 secondary ingredients.

For reference, this is the standard Recipe for [[Jerky]] in the [[Butcher]] ({{2Star}}), which can make both Jerky and Skewers.

== Sources and Strategies ==

While Skewers require [[Insects]] or [[Meat]] from a [[Foragers' Camp]] or [[Trappers' Camp]], it can be worthwhile for the efficiency multiplier to first turn the Insects or Meat into [[Jerky]] in a [[Smokehouse]] ({{3Star}}) or the [[Butcher]] ({{2Star}}). If you can afford to also use a [[Fuel]], you can multiply the number of Skewers you get from Insects and Meat by more than 3x. If you're lucky enough to get the Butcher and have no [[Beavers]] in your map, you can meet two of the [[Complex Food Need]] of everyone in your Village with just one [[Building]].

Skewers can be acquired from a [[Trade]]r. They have a value of 0.20 {{Amber}} [[Amber]], therefore a stack of 40 is worth 8.0 {{Amber}} to the Trader.


=== Production Chain ===

The production chain for Skewers looks like this.

==== First Ingredient: [[Jerky]] ====

Step 1 options:
* A [[Wormtongue Nest]] worked by a [[Foragers' Camp]] ({1Star}) produces [[Insects]] ({{1Star}}).
* A [[Slickshell Broodmother]] worked by a [[Trappers' Camp]] ({1Star}) produces [[Meat]] ({{1Star}}).
* A [[Ranch]] supported by [[Grain]] from a [[Small Farm]] and sustain production of [[Meat]] ({{1Star}}).

Step 2 options:
* A [[Smokehouse]] requires the [[Insects]] or [[Meat]] to produce [[Jerky]] ({{3Star}}).
* A [[Butcher]] requires the [[Insects]] or [[Meat]] to produce [[Jerky]] ({{2Star}}).


==== Second Ingredient: [[Vegetables]], [[Roots]], [[Berries]], or [[Eggs]] ====

* A [[Moss Broccoli Patch]] worked by a [[Foragers' Camp]] produces [[Vegetables]] ({{1Star}}).
* A [[Root Deposit]] worked by a [[Scavengers' Camp]] produces [[Roots]] ({{1Star}}).
* A [[Dewberry Bush]] worked by an [[Herbalists' Camp]] produces [[Berries]] ({{1Star}}).
* A [[Stormbird Nest]] or [[Snake Nest]] worked by a [[Scavengers' Camp]] or [[Trappers' Camp]] produces [[Eggs]] ({{1Star}}).
* The same [[Ranch]] for the [[#First Ingredient: Jerky|first ingredient]] supported by [[Grain]] from a [[Small Farm]] can sustain production of [[Eggs]] ({{1Star}}).
* [[Fertile Soil]] is improved to a [[Farm Field]].
** [[Farm Fields]] worked by a [[Small Farm]] produce [[Vegetables]] ({{1Star}}) (and can also support the [[Ranch]]).
** [[Farm Fields]] worked by a [[Plantation]] produce [[Berries]] ({{2Star}}).


==== Efficient sustainable production ====

If you need to sustain Skewers '''and Jerky''' and want to feel efficient at doing so, look here.
# [[Farm Field]]s worked by an [[Small Farm]] producing both [[Vegetables]] and [[Grain]].
# The [[Grain]] is used by a [[Ranch]] to produce [[Meat]] and [[Eggs]].
# A [[Butcher]] takes the [[Meat]] and a [[Fuel]] to make [[Jerky]].
# The same Butcher takes the [[Jerky]] and the [[Vegetables]] to make [[Skewers]].
