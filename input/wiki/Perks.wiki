[[File:Perks tray emphasized.png|thumb|Screenshot of a grown settlement's Perks. Notice the different border colors, including a Grain bonus of +1 in blue (third row) and +2 in purple (fifth row). The Village has x4 stacks of the +1 Grain and one stack of the +2 Grain bonus.]]
Perks cause a continuous effect on the settlement. They are obtained from [[Seasons]], [[The Forest]], [[Hearths]], [[Cornerstones]], [[Trade|Traders]], [[Glade Events]], some [[Buildings]], [[Biomes]], and [[World Map]] effects. A list of the current Perks to your settlement is visible in the bottom-left corner of the game window, arranged in a grid. Holding the mouse over these icons will show in a tooltip the name of the Perk, a description, and any additional details like multipliers or progress.

Perks with the same name can appear twice in the grid as separate Perks, because some Perks award different numeric values (for example, decreasing Hostility or increasing production of Fabric) depending on the rarity of the Perk. (See section on [[#Rarity|Rarity]], below.) They will have different numerical tokens on the icon and border colors, for example, '''+1''' with a green border and '''+2''' with a blue border. These tokens are on the bottom of the icon.

You can obtain some Perks more than once, and their effects will multiply. For example, a Perk increasing Bricks by +2 that you have obtained twice will increase Bricks by +4. Look for a small '''x2''' token at the top of Perk icons in the corner of your screen.

Some Perks award additional bonuses upon reaching thresholds. For example, Nets increases Meat production by +1 for every 25 Meat produced (or gathered or farmed). If, after obtaining the Perk, workers in your Trappers' Camps have gathered a total of 100 Meat, they will be gathering with a +4 bonus. Look for a small '''x2''' token at the top of Perk icons in the corner of your screen. Holding the mouse over these icons will show you your current progress towards your next threshold.

Except where explicitly noted by the description of the Perk, Perks are not retroactive and do not count retroactively. For example, [[Peasant Supplies]] ("Receive 3 Pack of Provisions for every new Villager") does not award packs for villagers already in the settlement. In contrast, [[Extraction Tools]] ''does'' count all already solved Glade Events, and its description explicitly says this.

== Rarity ==

[[File:Mystery_boxes_example.png|thumb|Screenshot of mystery boxes for sale by a trader]]
Perks have different rarities, indicated by their border color. In some cases, two Perks with the same name but different rarities give different results. The higher the rarity, the better the bonus.

The [[Trader]] [[Dullahan Warlander]] sells mystery boxes for [[Amber]] that contain at least one perk of the same rarity as the mystery boxes. Boxes with higher rarity Perks are more expensive.

Here are examples of the four rarity levels of Cornerstone Perks, as purchased from the Trader.
