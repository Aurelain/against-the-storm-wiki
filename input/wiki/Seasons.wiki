''Main article: [[Forest Mysteries]]

Forest Mysteries are generated at the start of each game, based on the mapâ€™s difficulty and biome. Some effects are simple modifiers influencing production, lowering speed or destroying buildings, but some are based on your villagers' needs. For example: Hailstorm can kill villagers during the Storm, but if they have a home, they are safe.

== Positive Forest Mysteries ==
Positive Forest mysteries are active during the Drizzle season.
