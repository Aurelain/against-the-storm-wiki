The Cookhouse is a [[Building|Food Production Building]] that is available from the beginning of the game as a [[Blueprint]] you can choose on each mission. It has a larger footprint than the other Buildings that make similar products.

== Construction ==

The Cookhouse's footprint is 4x3, which is bigger than most other Buildings. It takes 00:50 to build.

Construction requires:
* 8 [[File:Planks.png|32px]] [[Planks]]
* 4 [[File:Bricks.png|32px]] [[Bricks]]


== Workers ==

The Cookhouse has space for 4 [[Workers]], which is more than most other Buildings.

The Cookhouse's [[Specialization]] is [[File:Icon Spec Fire 64x64.png|16px|link=]] [[Warmth Specialization|Warmth]]. This is a '''Comfortable''' Specialization type, so the [[Lizards]] that work in the Cookhouse will gain +5 to their [[Resolve]].

== Recipes ==

The Cookhouse produces two [[Resources#Complex Food|Complex Foods]] and [[Pigment]], which is a [[Resources#Crafting Materials|Crafting Material]] used in [[Scrolls]] (for [[Education]]) and [[Cosmetics]] (for [[Cleanliness]]) or for producing [[Pack of Trade Goods|Packs of Trade Goods]].

== Strategy ==

Being able to make both [[Skewers]] and [[Biscuits]] in one Building means the Cookhouse can satisfy at least one [[Complex Food Need]] from any [[Species]] in your settlement. It is especially great for [[Harpies]], who only need [[Jerky]] from elsewhere to have all their Complex Food Needs met.

If you don't have [[Beavers]] in your map, then [[Jerky]] is everyone's Complex Food. Be careful not to spend all of your Jerky as ingredients for [[Skewers]], despite the efficiency of using the Jerky as the Skewers ingredient.


The Cookhouse is one of just a few [[Buildings]] that can produce two different [[Complex Food Need|Complex Foods]]. This short list includes:
* [[Bakery]] produces [[Biscuits]] (★★) and [[Pie]] (★★)
* [[Butcher]] produces [[Skewers]] (★★) and [[Jerky]] (★★), which leaves out [[Beavers]]' Complex Food Needs
* [[Cellar]] produces [[Pickled Goods]] (★) and [[Jerky]] (★)
* [[Cookhouse]] produces [[Skewers]] (★★) and [[Biscuits]] (★★)


You can park extra [[Lizards]] in the Cookhouse if their Resolve is low. Having four Worker slots means a Cookhouse can make the difference between Lizards leaving or not.

=== Production Chains ===

''Main articles: [[Skewers#Production Chain|Skewers]], [[Biscuits#Production Chain|Biscuits]], and [[Pigment#Production Chain|Pigment]]''

[[Berries]] are an important ingredient in the Cookhouse's [[Recipes]]. And [[Insects]] are in two of the three Recipes. If you have a sustainable supply of Berries, Insects, and [[Flour]], then you can make everything the Cookhouse offers.


If your settlement produces excess [[Grain]] (or Flour from Grain), consider adding a [[Ranch]], which can use that Grain to produce both the [[Meat]] and [[Eggs]] that the Cookhouse can turn into Skewers.


Unless you're getting the Cookhouse for Skewers, you will need a source of Flour before the Cookhouse can be most effective and make both its [[Complex Food]]s. Make sure you get a [[Provisioner]] (★★), [[Supplier]] (★★), or [[Rain Mill]] (★★★) going first, so your [[Workers]] can start making [[Biscuits]] right away.


Making [[Jerky]] first is a big multiplier for turning [[Insects]] or [[Meat]] into Skewers. If you have the [[Smokehouse]] or [[Butcher]], for example, and can afford to spend [[Fuel]]-type Resources, you can multiply the number of Skewers you get from Insects or Meat by more than 3x by first making them into Jerky.
