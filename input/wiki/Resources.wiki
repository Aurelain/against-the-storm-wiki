= Resources =

<blockquote>
''Gather everything you can and fulfill your villagers needs.''
</blockquote>

Your [[Settlement]] revolves around your resources. Some are gathered from map tiles, some are produced in [[Buildings]], some are rewarded from [[Glade Events]], and all of them will move around your settlement by villagers to fill [[Storage]], satisfy [[Recipes]], build Buildings and [[Roads]], and complete Glade Events. Resources are also moved invisibly and instantly through [[Trade]], [[Sacrificing]], and [[Orders]].

== Swapping Ingredients ==

[[File:Recipes_example.png|thumb|Two recipes shown in the game]]
[[File:Frame_UI_Swap_Ingredient.png|x58px|left|Look for this border around ingredients you can swap]] Whenever producing a new [[Recipe]], check to see which ingredients are allowed. If the Recipe accepts multiple ingredients, the resource icon will be round with rotating arrows around it. If the ingredient is required, for example Planks in the Barrels recipe, the icon will be square.

In the example screenshot, the top recipe is for Barrels. This Building is currently using Crystalized Dew for this recipe, but the rotating arrows around the icon means you can swap the ingredient. This recipe also has a fixed ingredient of Planks; the square border around the ingredient icon means you cannot swap this ingredient. The bottom recipe for Packs of Provisions is currently using Eggs, but that can be changed, indicated by the rotating arrow circular frame around the Eggs icon.

== Resources Panel ==

[[File:Resources Panel UI.png|thumb|Resources panel in game]]
[[File:Resources panel UI-crafting expanded.png|thumb|Showing '''Crafting Materials''' expanded]]
At any time, you can see the totals of different categories of resources at the top of your screen, to the left of the primary time display and controls.

The number on each category icon represents the total amount of those types of resources. Clicking on those icons reveals a grid below the panel showing icons for every resource from that category currently in [[Storage]]. The number below each of those icons is how many of that item your settlement has in Storage. It does not count items in Building inventories that are waiting to be consumed by Recipes or have been produced but not yet delivered to a Warehouse. The red or green arrow on each icon indicates whether the number of each category or resource has been trending up or down recently.

From left to right, the categories are the following:
# '''Food''' (Raw Foods like Berries and Roots and Complex Foods like Biscuits and Jerky)
# '''Building Materials''' (the main three—Planks, Bricks, and Fabric—and also Parts and Wildfire Essence)
# '''Consumable Items''' (for providing Services, such as Ale, Incense, and Scrolls)
# '''Crafting Materials''' (everything else that's part of a Recipe—like Flour, Pottery, and Reeds—and also Stone and Clay that are used in both Recipes and for building Roads)
# '''Trade Goods''' (Citadel resources, Amber, Packs of Goods, and Ancient Tablets)
# '''Fuel & Exploration''' (Wood, Tools, and fuel items like Coal and Sea Marrow)

== Recipes Panel ==

[[File:Icon RecipesButton.png|x58px|left|Recipes button]]
[[File:RecipesBookIcon.png|thumb|Recipes icon (fourth from left, like a book) in the top right of the screen]]
You can also see your current Resource amounts from the Recipes Panel. You can browse the Recipes Panel by either end Product or Ingredient - allowing you to see which [[Recipes]] either produce or use that Resource. If you uncheck Show All, it will only display the Resources and Buildings you have available. You can also check Show All to explore the full list of Recipes.

When browsing by Product, the left-hand side number indicates the current amount in Storage; and on the right-hand side you can set a Global Production Limit for that Resource. If you click on a Product, it will expand a menu showing which Buildings have Recipes for that Product - including which Ingredients can be used, how many Ingredients are required, and how many resulting Resources that Recipe will produce. It will also display all possible Resources which could be used to produce that Product in the bottom of the panel - including how many currently reside in your Storage.

When browsing by Ingredient, the left-hand side number indicates the current amount in Storage. If you click on an Ingredient, it will expand a menu showing all the Recipes from all the Buildings which use that Ingredient. If you have unlocked a particular Building, you can adjust which Ingredients are being used and apply a Building-specific Production Limit that overrides the Global Production Limit.

= Acquiring Resources =

Resources can be acquired in three ways: Gathered from Trees and Resource Deposits, Farmed from [[Farm Fields]], or Produced by Buildings. Some Gathered resources can also be Produced, while all Farmed resources are also Gathered.

== Trees ==

''Main article: [[The Forest#Trees]]''

Trees can be harvested by [[File:Woodcutters_Camp_icon.png|25px]] Woodcutters' Camp buildings to give [[File:Wood.png|25px]] Wood. They may also grant additional resources depending on the biome.

== Resource Deposits ==

''Main article: [[The Forest#Resource Deposits]]''

Resource deposits are spots that allow villagers to gather resources. Each deposit can have its own priority set, when it is preferred to be harvested more or less often than other deposits.

Resource deposits come in two sizes. With the exception of the tutorial, big resource deposits can only be found inside Dangerous Glades and Forbidden Glades.

Each deposit has a number of Charges, representing the amount of times it can be harvested. Small resource deposits can be harvested '''15''' times if they provide raw food, and '''20''' times if they provide raw crafting materials. Large resource deposits can be harvested '''70''' times. The number of Charges can be increased by certain Smoldering City upgrades.

= Food =

''Main article: [[Food]]''

Every few minutes, [[Villagers]] will go to rest at a [[Hearth]] and try to eat food from [[Storage]]. If they cannot eat, they will get a [[Resolve]] penalty. Alternatively, if [[Complex Food Need|Complex Food]] is available, villagers will eat that instead of raw food, rewarding a bonus to Resolve. Therefore, it is essential that your settlement have a steady income of food resources.

== Raw Food ==

Initially only Raw Food will be available around the beginning of each settlement. Raw Food prevents villagers from getting hungry, but will not satisfy their needs for [[#Complex_Food|Complex Food]]. Compared to the number and diversity of ingredients, Complex Food feeds more villagers than Raw Food. In general, plan ahead to convert Raw Food into Complex Food, so that you can feed more villagers sustainably and satisfy their needs for Complex Foods.

You can prevent your villagers from eating one or more of these Raw Food resources via [[Consumption Control]], once the [[Upgrade]] [[Obsidian Archives Level 3]] is unlocked. For example, if you are running low on Roots and need Flour, you may want to disable Roots in the Consumption panel.

== Complex Food ==

''Main article: [[Complex Food Need]]''

These food resources are produced from [[Recipes]] and will satisfy the villagers' needs for [[Complex Food Need|Complex Food]]. Villagers prefer these food items over [[#Raw_Food|Raw Food]] when resting at [[Hearths]]. Satisfying villagers with Complex Food is more efficient, because most Recipes yield more goods than the number of raw ingredients used to produce them.

Note that the ingredients [[Flour]], [[Grain]], and [[Herbs]] are not edible, but are required in many Complex Food recipes.

Also note that the amount of ingredients, the amount produced, and the time it takes to produce all vary depending on the Building in which the Recipe is working. Consult the [[Recipes Panel]] in the game or the specific, linked Building page or Resource page for these further details.

= Building Materials =

Building Materials are mostly used for constructing new [[Buildings]], however there are [[Recipes]] that require these materials as ingredients. All materials are refunded if a Building is demolished.

Note that the amount of ingredients, the amount produced, and the time it takes to produce all vary depending on the Building in which the Recipe is working. Consult the [[Recipes Panel]] in the game or the specific, linked Building page or Resource page for these further details.

Additionally, some of these resources are available as bonuses when villagers work deposits on map tiles. If you have no access to their main production methods, you will still find a few as bonuses. They are infrequent extra resources that happen during normal gathering (between 5% and 40% of the time, typically about 1-in-5 times). See [[Bonus Resources]] for more information.

= Crafting Materials =

Crafting Materials are goods used in Recipes, and most don't have another purpose except as intermediate products. These are the most diversely and frequently used resources, some being used in almost a dozen recipes. Materials for building [[Roads]] also falls into this broad category.

Crafting Materials are split into roughly two groups, one raw from the map and one produced in [[Buildings]]. The exceptions that appear in both lists are [[Crystalized Dew]] and [[Leather]].

Crafting Materials can frequently be found as rewards from [[Glade Events]] and [[Orders]].

Note that the amount of ingredients, the amount produced, and the time it takes to produce all vary depending on the Building in which the Recipe is working. Consult the [[Recipes Panel]] in the game or the specific, linked Building page or Resource page for these further details.

== Raw Crafting Materials ==

These Crafting Materials are gathered or farmed from map tiles with resource deposits. Some only need a [[Camps|Camp]] or [[Mine]], while others need [[Fertile Soil]] to be improved to [[Farm Field]]s and a nearby farming building.

Note that [[Crystalized Dew]] appears here because it can be farmed raw from the [[Grove]]. It is also produced in three buildings, listed here for quick reference, and its Recipe appears in the second table for Crafting Materials.

= Trade Goods =

Trade Goods are used in [[Trade]] and [[Orders]]. Generally, these items have the highest value of [[Amber]] among all of the resources because they are at the end of the production chains.

Producing these items consumes more ingredients than most other recipes, so be careful. When fulfilling Orders, setting limits is recommended, so you don't inadvertently use up all your building materials and food.

[[Amber]] is in this section, which is the currency of settlements and [[Trade]].

[[Citadel Resources]] are also in this section, which are awarded after completing [[Orders]] and from [[Glade Events]]. They are not producible by any Buildings.

Note that the amount of ingredients, the amount produced, and the time it takes to produce all vary depending on the Building in which the Recipe is working. Consult the [[Recipes Panel]] in the game or the specific, linked Building page or Resource page for these further details.

== Citadel Resources ==

Citadel Resources are special Trade Goods that are used to upgrade the Smoldering City.  Citadel Resources cannot be produced, instead you earn them by completing settlements on the [[World Map]].  You earn more if you complete a settlement next to a [[Modifier]].  You can also find them in [[The Forest]] by [[Trading]], solving [[Glade Events]], and completing [[Orders]].

== Tips on Trade Goods ==

Unlike Planks and Fabric, Bricks are not used in any Recipes except for Packs of Building Materials. Bricks are used in constructing buildings, but most buildings only require 2-4 Bricks. Service buildings tend to require more - usually 8 bricks (except for the Monastery which requires 20 Bricks). If you have a decent amount of Clay, it might be beneficial to primarily produce Packs of Building Materials using Bricks.

Berries can be farmed at Plantations (★★), Herbs can be farmed at Herb Gardens (★★), and Meat and Eggs can be produced by the Ranch (★). When producing Packs of Provisions, if you have any of those Buildings it might be beneficial to use their ingredients instead of Insects - which can be used to produce Jerky, Skewers, Pie, Incense, and Pigments.

Incense is probably the easiest ingredient to produce that is used in making Packs of Luxury Goods (just Wood and Herbs). Wine and Ale require vessels; Scrolls require Wine or Pigments; and Training Gear uses Stone, Copper Bars, or Crystalized Dew. Cosmetics is a close second (just Eggs and Herbs), but you may not run into the Buildings which produce it as easily as those for Incense.

= Fuel & Exploration =

This category includes the [[Fuel]] burned and [[Sacrificing|Sacrificed]] in [[Hearths]], the [[Wood]] obtained from opening [[Glades]], and the tools for opening [[Caches]] and solving [[Glade Events]].

== Raw Fuel Resources ==

The [[Fuel]] resources in this category can be gathered from resource deposits on the map tiles. There are [[Recipes]] for [[Coal]] and [[Oil]] in the next table of all Fuel & Exploration resources.

== Produced Fuel & Exploration Resources ==

Some of the Fuel & Exploration Resources are produced in [[Buildings]] from [[Recipes]]. [[Coal]] is also gathered via the [[Mine]], shown in the previous section.

Note that the amount of ingredients, the amount produced, and the time it takes to produce all vary depending on the Building in which the Recipe is working. Consult the [[Recipes Panel]] in the game or the specific, linked Building page or Resource page for these further details.
