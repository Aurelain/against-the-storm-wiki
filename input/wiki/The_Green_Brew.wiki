The Green Brew is considered one if not the best service building effect in Against the Storm. The effect drops your hostility an entire level, -100. It is not as useful when you are in lower difficulty under x3 hostility modifier. In essence, the monastery with The Green Brew effect is a strong choice anytime the blueprint comes up.
